We were charged with developing an easy to use weather tracking app that would allow the user to search for cities of interest to find weather data. The app allows the user to look at prior searched cities in their session. It also shows them current temperature and a five day forecast, set for each consecutive day at 15:00. The user can view temperature, wind speed, UV index and humidity.
